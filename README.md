# Group_Project_Grad_Rates

### Project Title: What’s impacting graduation rates in Minnesota?

### Team Members: Ashley, Andrew, Jack, Brian, Kate

### Git: https://github.com/alvern/Group_Project_Grad_Rates

### Project Description/Outline:

Educational success is impacted by a number of things outside of school and we have brainstormed a few factors that we believe may correlate to graduation rates. 

### Research Questions to Answer: 
Are Minnesota graduation rates being impacted by things like the median income of the area? How about pollution and proximity to superfund sites? Does access to broadband internet affect education? How do schools perform relative to local incarceration rates? Do urban areas perform better academically than rural areas?

We will compare and map this data to look for correlations.

Median income, rural vs. urban areas, proximity to superfund sites, accessibility of broadband, regional incarceration rates. Look for interesting correlations and be willing to adjust questions based on results and challenges. 

### Datasets to be Used: 
Minnesota Graduation Rates by School: http://w20.education.state.mn.us/MDEAnalytics/DataTopic.jsp?TOPICID=2

Minnesota School Addresses: http://w20.education.state.mn.us/MdeOrgView/search/tagged/MDEORG_DISTRICT_SCHOOL

Broadband Access: https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/

Department of Justice Information: https://www.justice.gov/developer

TRI Facilities: https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/efservice/tri_facility/state_abbr/MN/rows/

EPA Superfund Sites: https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/srchsites.cfm

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 

Clean graduation data into usable data frame

Add school addresses to data frame

Create data frames for other data sets (broadband access, DOJ info, TRI facilities)

Visualize Data with Matplotlib and Gmaps heatmap
 


## Notes from Scott:
-Be aware of and note things for which we *can’t* account. I.e. students bussed in from other areas
-Check standard deviation of income levels in a city.
