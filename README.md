### Project Description/Outline:
Educational success, as measured by graduation rate, can be impacted by a number of things outside of school. We have brainstormed a few sociopolitical factors that we believe may be associated with graduation rates and will be exploring each of these factors in relation to graduation rates. 

### Research Questions to Answer: 
Education: Are graduation rates associated with graduation cohort sizes or consistent attendance rates within schools? Pollution: Are graduation rates associated with proximity to superfund sides? Telecommunications: Is access to high-speed broadband internet associated with graduation rates? Economics: Are graduation rates associated with the median income of the area? Crime: Are graduation rates associated with local crime rates? We will compare and map this data to look for associations.
